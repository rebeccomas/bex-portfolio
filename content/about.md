# About Me

<p class="lp-text">I'm a designer based  in St. Louis, Missouri. </p>

<p> I graduated from Truman State University with departmental honors in 2020. Shortly after, I started working as a Web/Graphic Designer at Studio 2108, where I strengthened my UI design skills and picked up skills in web development, especially CSS. In 2024, I left Studio 2108 to pursue an opportunity as an in-house graphic designer at Grimco, Inc â€“ the largest distributor of products for the sign industry. As a designer with Grimco's marketing department, I use my versatility to create a variety of projects, including video, animation, 3D graphics, email marketing, web design, social media, documents, flyers, tradeshow signage, print samples, and more. I can tackle any project, deliver elevated professional results, and I never stop until I've gone beyond expectations. I seek creative solutions, delightful surprises, and that little spark that makes a design feel like magic.</p>
