# About Me

<p class="lp-text">I'm a designer based  in St. Louis, Missouri. </p>

<p> I graduated from Truman State University with departmental honors in 2020. Shortly after, I started working as a Web/Graphic Designer at Studio 2108. I've worked with all kinds of businesses in the St. Louis region and beyond. I can tackle any project, deliver stand-out results, and never stop until I've gone beyond expectations. I seek creative solutions, delightful surprises, and that little spark that makes a design feel like magic.</p>
