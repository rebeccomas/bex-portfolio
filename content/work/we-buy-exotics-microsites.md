# We Buy Exotics Microsites
<div class="subtitle">Design and Frontend Wordpress Development</div>

We Buy exotics is a luxury car buying service that makes it easy for luxury vehicle owners to sell or lease their car. Based in San Clemente, California, We Buy Exotics buys vehicles all over the United States.

## Project Goals
The aim of this project was to create a series of micro-sites to boost We Buy Exoticâ€™s SEO. Each site would target a separate customer base of owners of a particular make of luxury car who are looking to sell or lease their car. We Buy Exotics wanted the sites to look similar to one another, but distinct from the main We Buy Exotics site. To test the effectiveness of the campaign, we started with the Ferrari and Lamborghini sites, with the plan to create more microsites targeting owners of other kinds of luxury vehicle if the results were significant.

## Design
I designed the micro sites to have a luxury feel. Various layout treatments keep the content engaging. The CTA form is at or near the top of every relevant page, and each page is abundantly laden with CTA buttons that direct the user to the "request a quote" form for easy and convenient access, no matter when on the user's journey through the site they decide to take action. The first site (Sell My Ferrari) is able to function as a template for the Sell Your Lamborghini site, and the other micro-sites that We Buy Exotics plans to create in the future, so that each new site can be produced quickly from the base of the existing work.

## Development
Once the designs were approved for development, I was also responsible for building each of these sites in Wordpress using the Avada theme, as well as writing the css styles.
