# Hollenbeck Honey
<div class="subtitle">Branding, 3D Graphics, and Website Design</div>

As part of my BFA capstone, I designed a website for Hollenbeck Honey Farm, created 3D graphics and animations for the website, and redesigned their visual identity.

## Website
The Hollenbeck Honey website uses 3D graphics to focus on the honey itself and the bees that produced it. On the home page, the user is greeted by a wave of honey that covers the title, and some friendly bees that buzz about the page. Using the navigation in the upper right corner, users can navigate to different parts of the site, including the Products page, where they will see 3D-modeled representations of Hollenbeck Honey's honey products.

## 3D Graphics
I created several 3D models for this project, including a honeybee model and several product models. I also developed materials for the models.

## Print Products
In addition to the website and 3D graphics, I designed product labels and business cards to be used in the physical world by Hollenbeck Honey.
