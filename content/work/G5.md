# G5 Website Redesign
<div class="subtitle">Website Redesign</div>

G5 is a medical massage therapy machine producer who has been in the business for more than 50 years and is now a gold standard in the massage therapy industry. Used by professional athletes, physical therapists, and patients, G5 is known as a reliable producer of medical devices. However, G5's website, which hadn't been updated in nearly fifteen years when they came to us and was running on outdated web technology that made it difficult for them to edit the site's content, was not a visual match for their reputation. Additionally, G5 was growing their business and needed to reorient their website from focusing only on B2B sales to being an inviting B2C ecommerce experience as well. The brand needed a lift that would communicate their well-earned place in the world of modern medical technology, while simultaneously representing their identity as a trustworthy, established business, and being inviting enough for the average consumer to feel confident purchasing a machine from the site.

All design and graphics for this site are my work. Photography and logo assets were provided by the client. The site was developed by team members at Studio 2108.

## Project Goals
G5 wanted to redesign their website for the first time in nearly 15 years. Their goal was to update the look, make the site easier to use, and appeal to a wider audience including layman clientele so they could access a B2C market in addition to their existing B2B connections. They also wanted to improve their SEO with a new site structure and target optimized content developed by a marketing team we worked with. Visually, G5 wanted their redesigned site to highlight their products, acknowledge their history, and be creative.

## Design
I wanted the site to look modern and futuristic. After a trip to G5 headquarters to test out some of their machines, I created graphics for the site that visually represented some of the massage patterns their machines use. These vibrating patterns are ghosted in glowing green and teal over dark backgrounds. I also spiced up old photography for the site. Since this project was on a short deadline, there was no time to take new photography, so we had to draw from G5’s photography archives. I created eye-catching graphics to draw attention and add excitement to the product imagery. I wanted to employ surprise throughout this site to engage and delight the user. From the graphics, to the mega-menu,  to the footer, my goal was for everything in this site to delight the user.

## The Original Site:
The old G5 site, which hadn’t been redesigned since 2008, had some major problems. The menu was inconsistent page-to-page. The site, rather than having a responsive design, was a static width that was too small for today’s browser sizes and too wide for mobile devices.

My task was to give the site a whole new look and a new, responsive, user-friendly design that would help G5 in their shift toward B2C sales.

### Images

The client needed the new site fast for a showcase that was coming up. There was no time to take new photography, so I spruced up some old photos they provided. The result was decades old photography used in a modern way, simultaneously communicating the company's age and reliability as well as their relevance in the contemporary technological sphere. 

I took care in handling product photography, as G5's products were the purpose of the site. To bring attention to the devices, I created graphics that draw the eye inward to the product and add interest.
