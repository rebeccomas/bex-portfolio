# The Milkweed Mercantile
<div class="subtitle">Branding, 3D Graphics, and Website Design</div>

The Milkweed Mercantile is an Eco-friendly B&B and Caf√©. As part of my BFA capstone project, I redesigned the Mercantile's visual identity and website, as well as 3D graphics and animations for the website.

## Website
The website is designed to give a scroll-based flyover tour of a 3D representation of the Milkweed Mercantile, progressing smoothly through pages about each of the  Mercantile's aspects. These pages can also be reached quickly through a drop-down menu in the upper right corner if the viewer wishes to jump to a certain piece of information.

## 3D Graphics
The 3D models I created use simple emission materials that apply flat, unshadowed color to the models and give the graphics an illustrative quality.

## Print Products
I also designed decorative items to be used around the Milkweed Mercantile itself or as souvenirs for visitors.
