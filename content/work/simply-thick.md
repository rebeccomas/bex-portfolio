# Modern Dysphagia Cooking
<div class="subtitle">Microsite</div>

SimplyThick produces a food and beverage thickener for people living with swallowing disorders, also know as dysphagia. Their cookbook, *Modern Dysphagia Cooking*, includes recipes for use with their thickening products.

## Project Goals
The purpose of this project was to create a website for SimplyThick to advertise their new book, *Modern Dysphagia Cooking.* The site needed to be engaging, give a preview of food from the book’s recipes, show that cooking for dysphagia can be delicious and fun, and ultimately point users to the link to purchase the book. I designed a site that accomplished all these goals while staying consistent with the existing branding for the book. 

## Design
The graphics on the site reference the graphics in the book itself and other branding surrounding the book.  I created header, hero, and footer graphics that use a playful triangular design similar to Simply Thick’s advertisements for the book. The background patterns and playful graphics that decorate the page’s layout also hint back to the book's design. This, plus SimplyThick's food photography, employed over a creative angular layout, accomplished SimplyThick's goals of using the site to convey the message that cooking for dysphagia can be fun and delicious.
