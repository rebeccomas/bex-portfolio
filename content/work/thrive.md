# Thrive Women's Healthcare
<div class="subtitle">Event Invitation Mailer, Event graphics</div>

Druring my in-house design internship, I designed a mailer for Thrive's annual fundraising dinner and graphics to be used on-site at the event. For this project, I designed every part of the mailer, including the envelope, seal, card and a RSVP insert, chose paper for each, and put careful thought into how the graphics and typography corresponded to the event's theme. Thrive had a long list of contacts who it needed to send the mailer to, so I used Adobe InDesign's automation tools to add the correct names and addresses to hundreds of envelopes quickly. During the print production process, I did jobs including trimming, scoring, folding, and assembling the mailers in their envelopes.
