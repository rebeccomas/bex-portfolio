### Thrive St. Louis
Design Intern </br>
2018

<div class="small-text">

I worked on many projects that required me to design within Thrive’s brand guidelines, including a mailer for their annual fundraising dinner. For this project, I designed every part of the mailer, including the envelope, seal, card and a RSVP insert, chose paper for each, and designed the graphics and typography to correspond to the event’s theme. I used Adobe InDesign’s automation tools to add hundreds of unique recipient names and addresses to the envelopes quickly. During the print production process, I did jobs including trimming, scoring, folding, and assembling. During this position I used Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.
