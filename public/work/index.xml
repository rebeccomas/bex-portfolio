      <description>Thrive Women&amp;rsquo;s Healthcare Event Invitation Mailer, Event graphics Druring my in-house design internship, I designed a mailer for Thrive&amp;rsquo;s annual fundraising dinner and graphics to be used on-site at the event. For this project, I designed every part of the mailer, including the envelope, seal, card and a RSVP insert, chose paper for each, and put careful thought into how the graphics and typography corresponded to the event&amp;rsquo;s theme. Thrive had a long list of contacts who it needed to send the mailer to, so I used Adobe InDesign&amp;rsquo;s automation tools to add the correct names and addresses to hundreds of envelopes quickly.</description>

      <description>G5 Website Redesign Website Redesign G5 is a medical massage therapy machine producer who has been in the business for more than 50 years and is now a gold standard in the massage therapy industry. Used by professional athletes, physical therapists, and patients, G5 is known as a reliable producer of medical devices. However, G5&amp;rsquo;s website, which hadn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in nearly fifteen years when they came to us and was running on outdated web technology that made it difficult for them to edit the site&amp;rsquo;s content, was not a visual match for their reputation.</description>
